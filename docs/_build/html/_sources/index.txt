Computational Neutrino Physics
==========================================================


This project is part of `NeuPhysics <http://neutrino.xyz>`_ . The project `neutrino physics notes <http://docs.neutrino.xyz>`_ is meant for the theoretical part of neutrino physics. As the research is going on, numerical method shows its importance. Hence we set up this project to take notes on the computational aspects of neutrino physics.
